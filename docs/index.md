- üí∞ Optimized Cost. Requires 4x less computation, reducing cloud and hardware expenses.
- ‚ö° Quick Deployment. Deploy and fine-tune models with minimal effort.


## SDK Overview
The Focoos Python SDK provides seamless access to our state-of-the-art computer vision models. With just a few lines of code, you can easily **select, customize, test, and deploy** pre-trained models tailored to your specific needs.
Whether you're deploying in the cloud or on edge devices, the Focoos Python SDK integrates smoothly into your workflow, speeding up your development process.


### Quickstart üöÄ
Ready to dive in? Get started with the setup in just a few simple steps!

**Install** the Focoos Python SDK (for more options, see [setup](setup.md))
=== "uv"
    ```bash linenums="0"
    uv pip install 'focoos @ git+https://github.com/FocoosAI/focoos.git'
    ```

=== "pip"
    ```bash linenums="0"
    pip install 'focoos @ git+https://github.com/FocoosAI/focoos.git'
    ```

=== "conda"
    ```bash linenums="0"
    pip install 'focoos @ git+https://github.com/FocoosAI/focoos.git'
    ```

‚öôÔ∏è **Customize** the models to your specific needs by [fine-tuning](howto/personalize_model.md) on your own dataset.
```python
from focoos import Focoos
from focoos.ports import Hyperparameters

focoos = Focoos(api_key="<YOUR-API-KEY>")
model = focoos.new_model(name="awesome",
                         focoos_model="fai-rtdetr-m-obj365",
                         description="An awesome model")

res = model.train(
    dataset_ref="<YOUR-DATASET-ID>",
    hyperparameters=Hyperparameters(
        learning_rate=0.0001,
        batch_size=16,
        max_iters=1500,
    )
)
```

üöÄ **Use** the model with just few lines of [code](howto/use_model).

```python
from focoos import Focoos
from PIL import Image
# Initialize the Focoos client with your API key
focoos = Focoos(api_key="<YOUR-API-KEY>")

# Get the remote model from Focoos API
model = focoos.get_remote_model("<MODEL-REF>")

# Run inference on an image
detections, preview = model.infer(image_path, threshold=0.5, annotate=True)

# Output the detections
Image.fromarray(preview)
```
